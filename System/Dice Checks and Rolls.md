## General Rules
- Checks are made through rolling the 2d12 for a certain <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span>. When rolling.
##### Average Target Values:
- Impossible: 30
- Hard: 20
- Average: 14
- Easy: 10
#### Dice Pools:
- Every <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> will have a pool of dice associated with it with the default amount being 2d12. 
## Types of Checks:
#### <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> Checks
- These checks involve the players <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stats</span> and are often used to gather information or take basic actions. When making this type of check, the player will look at the given <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> their are rolling for. They will then add all relevant modifiers and roll the necessary amount of dice.
	Ex.
	- A player needs to roll for Guts. They roll a 22. They will then add their Guts modifier to the roll. They have +2 to Guts rolls. Their total roll would be their 22 + 2 (their guts modifier) = 24 total.
	- A player needs to roll for Deception. They roll a 7. Their Deception modifier is - 3. Their total roll would be 7 - 3 = 4
#### Degrees of Success
- When a player makes a check, they will try to roll higher than a events Challenge Level (CL). Their rolls will have various degrees of success based on their roll. These range from:
	- Total Success: The player does the desired action without consequence
	- Partial Success: The player does the desired action with some level of consequence
	- Partial Failure: The player does not complete the action, and something went well
	- Total Failure: The player des not complete the action, and there are more consequences
	Ex.
	- The player needs to make a CL 15 check.
		- 15-20 would yield a partial success
		- 21-24 would yield a total success
		- 10-14 would yield a partial failure
		- >10 would yield a total failure
#### <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span> & <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span>ing</span></span>
- When rolling a <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span>  Check, a player may choose to add an additional 1d6 to their roll, this is called **<span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span>ing</span>**. Doing so will cause the one of the players <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stats</span> to become <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span>. The <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> is the one the player chose to roll for.
	- If a player <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span>s</span> and succeeds the check, the player gains 1 <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span> in the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> they rolled for. 
	- If the player <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span>s</span> and fails the check, the player gains 2 <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span> in the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> they rolled for. 
- Each <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span></span> reduces the available dice pool for each roll in the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> by 1d6. The dice pool may not have more than 1d6 in it unless otherwise stated. If 2d6 would be put into a dice pool they combine into 1d12
	Ex.
	- 2d12 + 1 <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span> = 1d12 and 1d6
	- 2d12 + 2 <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span> = 1d12

- After making a check with a <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> or after a rest, the player loses the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> condition on that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span>. However, if a player <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span>s</span> while <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span>, the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> die effect still applies, and the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> effects add together. 
	Ex.
	- Player rolls 1d12 and 1d6 due to having 1 <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>. If they <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span> they roll 2d12 again.
		- If that player succeeds the roll, their next roll will by only 1d12, due to them gaining 1 <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>.
	- If a player loses all of their dice from <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>, they will automatically fail checks in the given <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> until they lose the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> condition.
#### Advantage and Disadvantage
- When a player has advantage on a roll they will re-roll one of their d12's and take the higher values. The opposite is true for disadvantage.
- If a player has both advantage and disadvantage, they lose both conditions.
#### Doubles
- When a player rolls doubles, they lose any <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 35, 53)">Strain</span>ed</span> conditions. The roll is treated as a total success and will yield the best outcome possible. 
*Optional.*
- When a player rolls double 1s, the GM may choose to make that a total failure.
#### Branch Tokens
- When a player gains a Branch Token, they may choose to expend it to get bonuses on rolls. Expending a Branch Token adds an additional 1d12 to a roll. 
#### Crippling Tokens
- When a player fails an <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(102, 82, 255)">Over Extend</span>ed</span> roll, or a player loses consciousness, the GM will gain Crippling Token. The GM may choose to use these tokens to impose negative effects on rolls. When using a Crippling Token, the chosen roll will have 1d12 subtracted from the roll. A player may not use a branch token to counteract this. 

## Combat
#### Attack Checks:
- Attack checks are made when a creature wants to deal damage to another. 
- An attack check is made with the same 2d12 system just like <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> Checks using the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> specified on weapon or attack being used in its Scaling Stat section. 
- If you have proficiency with a weapon you may add the bonus of the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> to the roll.
- Unlike <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Stat</span> checks, Attack checks are made against the Damage Avoidance of another creature as its CL. 
- The attack or weapon or Prowess abilities may grant extra bonuses to using certain attacks, granting a higher chance of success.
