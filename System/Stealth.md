## Stealth in Combat:
### Actions:
#### Hiding (<span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 33, 53)">Combative</span>):
- When taking the Hide Action you must spend an <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Action Point</span> then make a Stealth check the resulting value is your <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span>. 
- Taking this action will attempt to put your character into hiding. Enemies that may be able to see you must make a Perception Check above your <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span>. If they roll higher than your <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> you fail to hide, if they roll lower you successfully hide.
- If you are not obscured by objects or entities, your <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(181, 119, 228)"><span style="color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span></span> decreases by 18.
- When successfully hiding, you gain the Hidden condition.
#### Seeking (<span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 33, 53)">Combative</span>)
- When taking the Seek action you must spend an <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Action Point</span> then make a perception check. Doing so has the chance to reveal hidden creatures.
- You must take the Seek action before you may target a hidden creature.
### Conditions:
#### Hidden:
- While hidden you may not be targeted by Enemies unless they make a Perception Check above your <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span>. If they roll higher than your <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> lose the Hidden Condition.
- *While Hidden your attacks deal an additional 2 damage*
## Stealth out of Combat:
- Stealth out of combat revolves around the same system of <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> which may be determined via roll or passive.
- If a character is attempting to hide or sneak you may have them make a Stealth Check to become their <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span>. 
- If a character is **not** attempting to hide their <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> is equal to their Passive Stealth stat.
- While being stealthy outside of combat they are considered to have the Hidden Condition.
- If a creature is not obscured by objects or entities, their <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(181, 119, 228)"><span style="color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span></span> decreases by 18.

### Running Stealth:
- When running stealth outside of combat seeking creatures will be act in two stages: Inactive and Active.
- While hidden, creatures that make any check will also have to make a Stealth check that will become their new <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span>. A GM may have a player do this whenever they do an action drastic enough. 
#### Stealth Phases:
##### Inactive:
- The Inactive phase is used when creatures are being stealthy and not actively being looked for. 
- During this phase the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> of the hidden creatures will be tested against the Passive Perception of the creatures they are hiding from. 
- If a creatures Passive Perception if higher than the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> of a hidden creature move directly to the Searching phase.
- If a hidden creatures is revealed for any reason, move to the Active phase, the hidden creature is still hidden. 
##### Active
- The Active phase is used when creatures are being stealthy and actively being looked for. 
- During this phase the <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> of the hidden creatures will be tested against a Perception check made by creatures seeking. 
- If a hidden creature is revealed for any reason, that creature is no longer hidden. 
#### Passive Stealth:
- <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Passive Stealth</span> is used when a creature is not hiding but being actively looked for. During this time, a creatures <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Active Stealth</span> is considered to be their <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(181, 119, 228)">Passive Stealth</span>.
