## Cybernetic Slots:
- Cybernetics may by attaches to almost any part of your body, those parts include:
	- Head
	- Eyes
	- Mouth
	- Chest
	- **Shoulders**
	- Spine
	- Back
	- Arms
	- Hands
	- Legs
	- Feet
## Strain
- Everyone has a Cyber Strain Level, which is 10 + Guts which determines how many cybernetics your body can handle
- Each piece of cybernetic equipment has a **Strain** Level which increases the load taken on the body. 
- When using cybernetics there are three states of Strain that affect how the cybernetics effect you. 
	- Normal
	- Strained
	- Overclocked
#### Normal
- Total amount of strain from cybernetics < Cyber Strain Level
- Nothing happens, no lasting effects
#### Strained:
- Total amount of strain from cybernetics = Cyber Strain Level
- Roll all Overheat dice with a -1 modifier
- Overheat Point increases are doubled
#### Overclocked:
- Total amount of strain from cybernetics > Cyber Strain Level
- Roll all Overheat dice with a -2 modifier
- Heat Gauge increases are tripled
## Overheat
- When using a cybernetic's action you will have to roll its Overheat die. Rolling a 1 on said die will result in adding 1 to the Overheat on the cybernetic. If the Overheat die is more than 1 die, roll them and take the lower.
#### Overheat Threshold:
- The Overheat threshold is a value on each cybernetic that determines how much heat is being stored. If the heat goes to high bad things happen.
#### Overheated State:
- Each Overheat will be counted and compared to the Overheat Threshold of the cybernetic, if the Overheat threshold is reached or exceeded, the cybernetic is put into an Overheated state. 
- When a cybernetic is in the Overheated state, subsequent 1s rolled on the Overheat die will result in a Malfunction causing the cybernetic to fail. The user may no longer use the cybernetic once it has malfunctioned due to heat and it must be repaired.
- When a cybernetic is in the Overheated state, using actions of the cybernetic will increase its strain on the user. Each use will cause a strain increase of 1 which will clear after the Overheated state is cleared.
- While a cybernetic is in the Overheated state, its Overheat abilities may be used.
#### Clearing Overheat:
- During each [[Playing the Game#Rest:|Rest]] 1 Overheat point is removed from each cybernetic you have. During a [[Playing the Game#Full Rest:|Full Rest]]
- Some [[Playing the Game#Camping:|Camping]] abilities may reduce overheat as well. 

## Malfunction:
- When a cybernetic Malfunctions it closes up and stops working. While a cybernetic is malfunctioned its strain increases by half its current strain rounded up. 
- A malfunctioning cybernetic may either work improperly or not work at all, this depends on the cybernetic and the GM's ruling.
