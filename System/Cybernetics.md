#### Strain
Every player has a Cyber Strain Level, which is 10 + Constitution (plus prof is proficient) 
Each piece has a **Strain** Level which increases the load taken on the body. 

Strain has three states:
- Normal
- Strained
- Overclocked

Normal (Amount of Strain is < Cyber Strain Level):
- Nothing happens, no lasting effects

Strained (Amount of Strain is = Cyber Strain Level):
- Roll all Overheat dice with a -1 modifier
- Overheat Point increases are doubled

Overclocked (Amount of Strain is > Cyber Strain Level):
- Roll all Overheat dice with a -2 modifier
- Heat Gauge increases are tripled
- Using Cybernetic active abilities requires a DC 17 Constitution Saving Throw or the user takes 1 point of exhaustion




#### Overheat
When using a Cybernetic Active ability you will have to roll its Overheat die. Rolling a 1 on said die will result in adding 1 to the Overheat on the cybernetic. If the Overheat die is more than 1 die, roll them and take the lower.

Each Overheat will be counted and compared to the Overheat Threshold of the cybernetic, if the Overheat threshold is reached or exceeded, the cybernetic is put into an Overheated state. 

When a cybernetic is in the Overheated state, subsequent 1s rolled on the Overheat die will result in a Malfunction causing the cybernetic to fail. The user may no longer use the cybernetic once it has malfunctioned due to heat and it must be repaired.

When a cybernetic is in the Overheated state, using active abilities of the cybernetic will increase its strain on the user. Each use will cause a strain increase of 1 which will clear after the Overheated state is cleared.

When a cybernetic is in the Overheated state, its Overheat abilities may be used.

During each rest 1 Overheat point is removed from each cybernetic. During a long rest you may spend hitdice to reduce these points further with 1 Overheat point per hitdice spent. This point only applies to one cybernetic. 

#### <font style="color:#eb3d34">Malfunction</font>:
When a cybernetic Malfunctions it closes up and stops working. While a cybernetic is malfunctioned its strain increases by half its current strain rounded up.
