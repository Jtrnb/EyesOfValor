	- Point: The action will perform at a point over a distance. This distance is fixed.
	- Melee: The action will perform in a direction from its origin.
	- Cone: The action will perform in a cone from its origin.
- If the origin of the action moves so does the actions area of effect. 
	- Ex. A line from a player 4 tiles to the right will hit the first obstacle in those 4 tiles.
		- If the player is moved before the action resolves, the line will move with them in the same direction
	- Ex 2. A point from a player 4 tiles to the right will hit the tile it is targeting.
		- If the player is moved before the action resolves, the point will move with them in the same direction maintaining the same distance.
## Turn Order:
#### Turns:
- Turn order is determined by each characters Reaction and which side of combat they are on.
- Each side has their own turn order, and both loop independently of each other. With the order being based on who has the highest Reaction Value. The two turn orders alternate, starting with whoever has the highest Reaction

## Weapons, Proficiency and Mastery:
#### Weapons:
- Weapons are tools that may be used to harm your enemies.
- Weapons fall into 3 main categories, Small, Medium and Large. With each category varying in capability, including melee and range. 
#### Ranged Weapons:
- Ranges weapons may have a maximum and minimum range.
- Attacks made outside of the maximum range have disadvantage and do half damage.
- Attacks made below the minimum range do an additional 2d4 damage and are made at disadvantage. 
#### Proficiency:
- Having proficiency with a weapon allows the user to use the Scaling Stat of a weapon when using it. 
- If you do not have Proficiency with a weapon you do not use the Scaling Stat and [[Dice Checks and Rolls#Attack Checks|Attack Checks]] are simple made with the dice poll of the stat, without the bonus. 
#### Mastery:
- Weapons often require training to use, and like any skill one can master the arts of using a weapon.
- Gaining mastery in a weapon allows the user to use Mastery Features on weapons, providing an upper hand in combat. 
- If you have Mastery with a weapon you automatically have Proficiency with that weapon
