## Beast Loyalty:
- Every beast, both mechanical and wild has a loyalty which determines how it will act toward you. It's behavior is determined by the following table.
- When you have a Beast fully loyal to you, you may designate it as your partner. You may only have 1 Partnered beast during a Hunt. However, you may switch your partnered beast during [[Playing the Game#Downtime:|Downtime]].
- Most beasts will have a starting loyalty of 0-1.

| 0                 | The Beast is actively hostile toward you                                                                                                                                         |
| 1                 | The Beast does not mind you, but may try to avoid you.                                                                                                                           |
| 2                 | The Beast is welcoming to you, but not trusting of you. It will not follow many of your commands, nor will it trust your party members.                                          |
| 3                 | The Beasts trusts you enough for you to give it simple commands, and maybe take it into a fight, maybe. It is still apprehensive toward your party                               |
| 4                 | The Beast trusts you and will allow you to take it into combat. You may give it many commands and it is comfortable around your party.                                           |
| 5                 | The Beast trust you fully and trusts your party enough to care for it. You may teach it any amount of complex commands.                                                          |
| 6                 | The Beast is your partner and may use its partner abilities. This beast does not count toward the maximum number of beasts you can bring on a [[Playing the Game#Hunts:\|Hunt]]. |
