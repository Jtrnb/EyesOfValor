#### Beast Loyalty:
- Every beast, both mechanical and wild has a loyalty which determines how it will act toward you. It's behavior is determined by the following table.
- - Most beasts will have a starting loyalty of 0-1. 
#### Partnered Beasts:
- When you have a Beast fully loyal to you, you may designate it as your partner. You may only have 1 Partnered beast during a Hunt. However, you may switch your partnered beast during [[Playing the Game#Downtime:|Downtime]].
#### Beast Trainability:
- The trainability of a beast determines how high the Challenge Level of Animal Handling checks should be when attempting to tame the beast.

## Taming Beasts:
- When taming any beast you will need to increase its loyalty value through various different methods. This is divided into 3 main stages: Breaking the Ice, Basic Training and Companionship. With the time and effort of each being more than the last. 
- Breaking the ice and Basic training will most likely be started during a [[Playing the Game#Hunts:|Hunt]] however most of the progress will happen during [[Playing the Game#Downtime:|Downtime]]. You should try to increase your loyalty with a beast by 1 every time you have [[Playing the Game#Downtime:|Downtime]]. 
#### Breaking the Ice (Loyalty 0-1):
- To break the ice with a beast you must find a way to lure the beast in, and gain its trust.
- The Trainability of the beast is its full value.
#### Basic Training (Loyalty 2-3):
- Once the beast is comfortable around you and will follow you to some success you will have to train it and keep it happy. Doing so will keep the beast around and unlock its potential.
- The Trainability of the beast is 3 less.
#### Companionship (Loyalty 4-6):
- Once the beast will follow basic commands and join you on some hunts it will require more effort to improve its life and effectiveness. 
- Through more rigorous training and studying of the beast you will be able to raise it into a wonder companion and partner. 
- The Trainability of the beast 6 less. (or 12 less at loyalty 6)
## Taming Wild Beasts:
- Wild beasts or Organic Animals have different basic requirements to take them in as pets and companions than their mechanic counter parts.

#### Override Codes:
- All mechanical beasts have an override code used to take control of the beast. Finding and using these will making taming and controlling mechanical beasts extremely easy. However, not all overrides are created equal and you may need to find more than one to have a fully loyal mechanical beast.
#### Breaking the Ice:
- Breaking the Ice with a mechanical beast often requires you to find what parts need to be repaired or the proper override code. Fixing it will be a more natural form of taming where override is more effective. 
#### Basic Training:
