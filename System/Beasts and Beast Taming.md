## Beast Loyalty:
- Every beast, both mechanical and wild has a loyalty which determines how it will act toward you. It's behavior is determined by the following table.
- When you have a Beast fully loyal to you, you may designate it as your partner. You may only have 1 Partnered beast during a Hunt. However, you may switch your partnered beast during [[Playing the Game#Downtime:|Downtime]].
- Most beasts will have a starting loyalty of 0-1.

| 0                 | The Beast is actively hostile toward you                                                                                                                                         |
| 1                 | The Beast does not mind you, but may try to avoid you.                                                                                                                           |
| 2                 | The Beast is welcoming to you, but not trusting of you. It will not follow many of your commands, nor will it trust your party members.                                          |
| 3                 | The Beasts trusts you enough for you to give it simple commands, and maybe take it into a fight, maybe. It is still apprehensive toward your party                               |
| 4                 | The Beast trusts you and will allow you to take it into combat. You may give it many commands and it is comfortable around your party.                                           |
| 5                 | The Beast trust you fully and trusts your party enough to care for it. You may teach it any amount of complex commands.                                                          |
| 6                 | The Beast is your partner and may use its partner abilities. This beast does not count toward the maximum number of beasts you can bring on a [[Playing the Game#Hunts:\|Hunt]]. |

## Taming Beasts:
- When taming any beast you will need to increase its loyalty value through various different methods. This is divided into 3 main stages: Breaking the Ice, Basic Training and Companionship. With the time and effort of each being more than the last. 
#### Breaking the Ice (Loyalty 0-1):
- To break the ice with a beast you must find a way to lure the beast in, and gain its trust.
#### Basic Training (Loyalty 2-3):
- Once the beast is comfortable around you and will follow you to some success you will have to train it and keep it happy. Doing so will keep the beast around and unlock its potential.
#### Companionship (Loyalty 4-6):
- Once the beast will follow basic commands and join you on some hunts it will require more effort to improve its life and effectiveness. 
- Through more rigorous training and studying of the beast you will be able to raise it into a wonder companion and partner.
