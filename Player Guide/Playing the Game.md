## Downtime:
- Every game of EoV starts in downtime with you gearing up and preparing for a hunt. 
- During Downtime you will be interacting with other people and deciding what you should bring on your next hunt. You will be able to pick and choose what items you will bring filling your [[Creating A Character#Capacity:|Capacity]]. 
- During downtime you will gain the benefits of a Full Rest and any buffs and debuffs will be cleared. (Buff and Debuff dependent). 
- During downtime you may use any [[Downtime Actions]] during this time, your party may use a number of [[Downtime Actions]] equal to the number of party members. 
- During downtime you will plan out your next Hunt, deciding where to go and what the purpose of your next hunt will be.
## Hunts:
- Hunts are where EoV shines, this is where you will be testing your skills to prove your worth, and survive. A Hunt may include a variety of objectives such as: killing a beast, travel, securing an object, etc. 
- During a Hunt you will be achieving the objective determined during your last downtime.
- When successfully finishing a Hunt you will be granted anything you find during your hunt as a reward. You will also be paid determined by the hunt and person who gave you the task. You will all level up as well. You will also return to downtime. 
	- The GM may choose to change any of the prior rewards and rules.
- If you fail a Hunt, through either having to leave or dying you will not be rewarded, and you will return to downtime. 
#### Camping:
- During a hunt you may have many tasks that take longer than one day to do, in this instance you may choose to camp and allow your party to gear up and recover. During this time you may rest and gain their benefits. 
- You may use [[Downtime Actions]] during this time, however your party may only use 2. 
## Rest:
- Rest is something all Valor's have to do, without proper recovery people get hurt. There are two type of rest, each with its own benefits.
#### Full Rest:
- A Full Rest is an 8 hour time period of non-strenuous activity, such as sleep. 
- During a full rest you and your party will regain all of their missing Hitpoints. 
#### Partial Rest:
- A Half Rest can range from 2-4 hours of non-strenuous activity. 
- During a partial rest you and your party will regain half of their missing Hitpoints, **not** half of their maximum Hitpoints. 
## Travel:
- Travel is an in-between of Hunting and Downtime when you are moving your [[The Sojourn|Sojourn]] from one location to another. 
- When traveling locations can be Near(1day), Distant(2-4days), and Remote(5+days)
- Each day of travel a [[Playing the Game#Hunts|Hunt]] occurs whether planned or not
## Injury:
- Taking injuries is bound to happen to a Valor, tis the nature of the job. 
- There are two types of injury in EoV, being light and severe, each with their own negative effects.
