## Determining Stats:
#### Determining <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Base Stats</span>:
- All 15 Stats are separated into 5 main categories: Strength, Deftness, Intellect, Instinct, and Charm.
- Each category will be determined by rolling 2d4 and using the value to determine the modifier of the stats in the provided category.
- First you will roll 2d4, and use the outcome to add points to each stat in a category. Each point added to a stat increases its modifier by +1. Keep in mind that each stat has a base of -1, and investing a point will set it to +0.
- For one category you may roll 3d4 and keep the two highest. This is to ensure your main stat is mostly positive. 
- Ex.
	- To determine: the Strength category you must roll 2d4, you roll a 6. You then will distribute the points to each stat in the category: Strength, Guts, and Endurance.
	- Default: Strength: -1, Guts: -1, Endurance: -1
	- Distributing the 6 points: Strength: -1 + 3 = +2, Guts: -1 + 2 = +1, Endurance: -1 + 1 = +0
	- Your character would have a +2 in Strength, a +1 in Guts and a +0 in Endurance. 
- Ex. 2
	- To determine: the Strength category you must roll 2d4, you roll a 3. You then will distribute the points to each stat in the category: Strength, Guts, and Endurance.
	- Default: Strength: -1, Guts: -1, Endurance: -1
	- Distributing the 6 points: Strength: -1 + 1 = +0, Guts: -1 + 2 = +1, Endurance: -1 + 0 = -1
	- Your character would have a +0 in Strength, a +1 in Guts and a -1 in Endurance.

- Your starting DA is equal to 9 + Evasion.

## Prowess:
- A characters Prowess is their focus or "class". It determines their starting point on the [[Prowess Tree.canvas|Prowess Tree]] which allows them to take abilities curated to their Prowess. 
- When leveling up* you will gain Prowess Points to redeem upgrades through the [[Prowess Tree.canvas|Prowess Tree]]. 
- Each character Starts with 3 Prowess Points to be used. 
#### The Prowess Tree:
- The [[Prowess Tree.canvas|Prowess Tree]] contains all of the classes and abilities your character will be able to get as they become more skilled

## Inventory:
- Your character inventory is very limited when determining how much gear you can bring out on Hunts. 
#### Capacity:
- Your base inventory provides you with a Capacity of 4 + Endurance, Capacity being a value that will be filled by the items you bring.
- Each item you carry will have a Capacity value. The Capacity value of your items may not exceed your personal Capacity value. If an item does not have a Capacity it is treated as bearing no weight and it free to carry. 
- While not on a [[Playing the Game#Hunts:|Hunt]], you may store items and move as much as you would like around. Capacity only applies while out on a [[Playing the Game#Hunts:|Hunt]], or during travel depending on your GM.
## Beasts and Pets:
- As a Valor you may find yourself wanted to keep a creature as a pet. You may have any number of beasts tamed and under your jurisdiction however you may not bring that many on [[Playing the Game#Hunts:|Hunts]]. The amount of beasts you may bring on a Hunt is equal to your **Beast Handling - 6**.
