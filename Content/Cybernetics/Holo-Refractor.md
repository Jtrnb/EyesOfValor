While you control a holographic image, whenever you take damage or make a saving throw not related to this cybernetic, you must succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or the holographic image disappears. 

As a bonus action you may command the holographic image to mimic an action, or move. 

Overheat Ability: While this cybernetic is Overheated, as an action you may cause an existing holographic image to explode, causing all creatures looking at it within 15 feet of it to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded for 1 round.
